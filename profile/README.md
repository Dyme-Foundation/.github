## Welcome to the Dyme Foundation repo 👋

Dyme is a DAO-managed Web 3.0 reserve cryptocurrency built on Cosmos.

Dyme was developed to promote the adoption and growth of Web 3 by addressing these challenges. Dyme is part of the Cosmos <a href="https://interchain.io/">Interchain</a>, built on Ignite and using <a href="https://dyme.network/what-is-cosmos-and-why-is-it-called-the-internet-of-blockchains/">Cosmos SDK</a>. We believe Dyme expands on the Cosmos “Internet of Blockchains” in a positive way by providing the economic models and exemplars of use for Web 3 projects and by offering a reserve cryptocurrency for those projects to use.

Dyme tackles the challenge in three main areas necessary for a decentralized but standardized economic structure: democratic governance, decentralized management, and transparent economic structures and goals.

## Ignite modules Dyme has built 🧙

Dyme's largest contribution to the Cosmos community is an entirely new governance module. We will shortly publish the code to the Cosmos community.

The codebase shifts from the stock Ignite "one token, one vote" to a "one wallet, one vote" model. This caused some understandable development headaches. ;-)

The governance module follows Dyme's particular governance path. This path follows the same flow as other Cosmos chains, beginning with a proposal being 

Dyme's first project Lifetoken built a new scheduler module which has been incorporated into Dyme. The scheduler module will also shortly be published to the Cosmos community.
