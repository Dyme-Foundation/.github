Dyme is a DAO-managed Web 3.0 reserve cryptocurrency built on Cosmos.

Dyme was developed to promote the adoption and growth of Web 3 by addressing these challenges. Dyme is part of the Cosmos Interchain, built on Ignite and using Cosmos SDK. We believe Dyme expands on the Cosmos “Internet of Blockchains” in a positive way by providing the economic models and exemplars of use for Web 3 projects and by offering a reserve cryptocurrency for those projects to use.

Dyme tackles the challenge in three main areas necessary for a decentralized but standardized economic structure: democratic governance, decentralized management, and transparent economic structures and goals.
